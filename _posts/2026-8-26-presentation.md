I don't think most people understand me, or know me at all.
There a few that get me, and I appreciate them for it.
But that's because I've allowed them to see a glimpse of me.

But the main problem really, is that I don't really know myself either. I think I hold off too much on showing myself to the world. 
That's a problem to me and to the world.
Because the more I learn about the world and people, the more I see a difference in 
myself and the world. 

I think I am a gem in this world, and I gave a gift of a unique brain and creativity and
humor and just a love for learning and doing things in ways that others don't or haven't 
seen. 

so I don't care that I'm not the most technical or cracked person ever.
Because that's not my strength.
My strength can allow me to become very skilled in hard technical skills,
but really,
I have a unique brain capable of bringing creativity and beauty to this world.
and I've stuffed it away for a long time, leading to me not understanding who I am.
hiding my gift. doing a disservice to this world. 

My strength comes in creating. The more I create, the more opportunities
I have to do something unique, creative, beautiful. that only I, or a handful of people
in this world, could have done.

I need to create more, because I love it, but also because it's a gift to this world.

I can't believe I haven't.... there's such bursts of this energy 
that either happen for a good while then disappear, or leak out
in small details. like post it note jots, white board drawings, 
instagram posts, etc.

Maybe I am neurodivergent in this manner of creation. 
And that's my strength. 
People enjoy when I create some things and artificats,
because they haven't seen it before.


Everything I do. Everything. 
I rapidly get better, do better than others,
maybe because I vertically scale up faster,
or maybe it's because I take an adjacent path
that provides a better way of doing things...   


The weird thing I noticed about intelligence is,
and it's super obvious but I don't think it's spoken about enough,
that intelligence is invisible. 

It is so invisible, that you have to make it visible or else
noone will know. and most of the time, will assume you're dumber. 

And it's such a funny and weird concept to think about atleast for me.
because intelligence is not a thing? in a sense. it can only be measured 
by things that you do. it's an invisible thing that can only be measured
externally through visibile things, but never itself.


So maybe there is a high importance of visibility here that I haven't 
been taking care of. 

because I've always neglected this aspect. I would appear dumb in public and in 
social settings, then come home and go back to something that I've been learning.
and I would brush it off as oh, well i did something dumb today but atleast i am
content because i know who i am.
