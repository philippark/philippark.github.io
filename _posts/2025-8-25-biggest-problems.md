Recently read Chip Huyen's blog on [personal growth](https://huyenchip.com/2024/04/17/personal-growth.html).

I like the idea of figuring out what your biggest problems are currently, and trying to solve it as fast as possible. This allows for more room to dedicate on other more fun things. 

It didn't require lots of thinking to find out what my biggest problem is, and right now that's technical skill. I need to target and become as technically strong as possible as quick as possible. Right now, that's the obvious of leetcoding and technical interview skills. But also, it's my technical skill in hard technicals. like compilers, ai/ml, operating systems, low level, concurrency, etc. and system design. these are hard problems, and will only increasingly be more important as ai takes over lots of other areas of swe. 

essentially, in youthful terminalogy, i need to become cracked. as soon as possible. this is the big problem right now at this stage of my life. and i ~~need to~~ should "solve" this as quick as possible. 

after asking chatGPT what cracked people like:
* low level systems and hardcore topics
* math and theory
* problem solving communities
* toy projects that aren't really toys
* speedrunning CS textbooks for fun

Lines up with my personal experience of being around the smartest people I know. So this will be what I'm targeting.
